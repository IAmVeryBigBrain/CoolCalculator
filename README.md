# CoolCalculator
This is a Python program that creates a calculator that can perform various mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, cube root, and finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle. It also has the ability to calculate the distance between two points in 2D space, the slope of a line given two points, and the midpoint of a line segment in 2D space. It prompts the user to input the type of calculation they want to perform, and then prompts them to input the necessary values for that calculation. Finally, it displays the result of the calculation and waits for the user to press Enter to close the program.
I uploaded the file in a exe file so you don't need anything besides a computer to run this.
To download it, click on the lastest release and click on the .exe file. It will automatically download. To run the file just click on it and it will open.
If it says my file has malware/virus/troja/phishing on VirusTotal it is because i did not want to pay to have the file verified.
If you want to use this for commercial purposes, you will need a link to this repository and mention me. 
If you want to run this file on a phone, just download a python interpreter app and download the .py file in the latest version. It should run as normal.
