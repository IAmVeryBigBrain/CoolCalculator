# CoolCalculator
This is a very simple calculator with basic needs only.
I uploaded the file in a exe file so you don't need anything besides a computer to run this.
To download it, click on the lastest release and click on the .exe file. It will automatically download. To run the file just click on it and it will open.
If it says my file has malware/virus/troja/phishing on VirusTotal it is because i did not want to pay to have the file verified.
If you want to use this for commercial purposes, you will need a link to this repository and mention me. 
If you want to run this file on a phone, just download a python interpreter app and download the .py file in the latest version. It should run as normal.
